    - #### (1) Under the `Google Cloud Console`, I created a _**'Google Cloud Function'**_. See photos below for the steps, errors, and troubleshooting I performed to complete this section.

    - #### (2) In this photo, I attempted to add 'Soriano' in the `last_name` field. However, I couldn't click the `RUN TEST` button. After multiple failed attempts to add the last_name, I opted to use only the first name. But, I persisted and tried again, only realizing after multiple attempts and troubleshooting that I had forgotten to add a comma (,) after typing 'Raqs' in the `firstname`. After this, I was able to run the test, the execution response appeared, and lastly, I deployed the test.

    - #### (3) URL copied after deployment:

    - #### (4) I opened `Google Collab` and followed the steps below:
      
      <img src="https://github.com/raqssoriano/HHA504_assignment_functions/blob/main/GCP-functions/18%20-%20collab%20success.jpg" width="600" />.

    - #### (5) Going back to `Google Cloud Console` âž™ I navigaged to the newly created function `function-01` and click 'Code'. I copied Professor Hants' code from his GitHub repository under `HHA-504-2024` [gcp_function.py](https://github.com/hantswilliams/HHA-504-2024/blob/main/other/module5/gcp_function.py), and pasted it into my GCP `main.py`. See the photo below.

    - #### _*Note:*_ The photo shown below is the error I encountered even before successfully resolving the issue in **step (2)**, which was forgetting to include a comma (,) after the _**systolic value**_ of "`130`"

    - #### (6) After performing step (5), deploying `function-01` or 'the test' was successful, so I went ahead and copied the URL.

    - #### (7) Same as in step (4) above, I opened `Google Collab`, followed the steps below, and the outcome was successful.ðŸ™‚

# â˜ž _**Creating a Cron Job**_
---

  - # GitHub Actions
    
    - #### (1) Created a new GitHub repository named `504-cron-job` and opened my _**Visual Studio Code**_ and used the `git clone` command.


    - #### (2) Added a `requirements.txt` file, listing the necessary scripts/languages to complete to this assignment. I also added a `.venv` or virtual environment file.

        <img src="https://github.com/raqssoriano/504-cron-job/blob/main/Cron%20Job/1%20-%20soln%20to%20error%20(vsc).jpg" width="650" />.


    - #### (3) Created a new file named `.github` with a subfolder named `workflows`, containing a YAML file called **`pubmed_update.yaml`**. This file contains a _**scheduled task**_ that will be executed in a console.
      
        <img src="https://github.com/raqssoriano/504-cron-job/blob/main/Cron%20Job/2%20-%20yaml.jpg" width="650" />.


    - #### (4) Created a new file named `pubmed_action_github.py` containing a script that logs a _**scheduled task**_ to be executed in a console using GitHub actions.
      
        <img src="https://github.com/raqssoriano/504-cron-job/blob/main/Cron%20Job/3%20-%20pubmed%20file.jpg" width="650" />.


    - #### (5) I ran all scripts one at a time, encountering no errors until the final two lines: `email = resend.Emails.send(params)` and `print(email)`. I tried all available resources, I eventually ran out of options and felt so frustrated."
      
        <img src="https://github.com/raqssoriano/504-cron-job/blob/main/Cron%20Job/6%20-%20import%20-%20ok.jpg" width="400" />.

        <img src="https://github.com/raqssoriano/504-cron-job/blob/main/Cron%20Job/8%20-%20pubmed.jpg" width="650" />.


    - #### *Note:* This is the part where I spent too much time troubleshooting due to repeated error messages like `API key is invalid` and other confusing errors. See the photo below that shows the error message I've been getting.
          
        <img src="https://github.com/raqssoriano/504-cron-job/blob/main/Cron%20Job/9%20-vsc%20-%20error%20-%20API.jpg" width="650" />.


    - #### (6) Troubleshooting steps I have taken:
      
      - ran `pip install resend` command
      - checked for any punctuation errors and misspelled words
      - changed the email address included in the scripts inside `pubmed_github_action.py` file to match the one I used in GitHub
      - ensured that the `.env` file was created and contained the `API key` I received on the **Resend** website after creating a new account using my `stonybrook.edu` email. I also ensured that I copied the correct path in the `pubmed_action_github.py` file.
        
          <img src="https://github.com/raqssoriano/504-cron-job/blob/main/Cron%20Job/4%20-%20copy%20path%20to%20yaml.jpg" width="650" />.
        
      - ensured that I created a repository secret containing my `RESEND_API_KEY`

             <img src="https://github.com/raqssoriano/504-cron-job/blob/main/Cron%20Job/4%20-%20resend%20api%20key.jpg" width="650" />.

      - saved all changes to each file I modified, then used `git add`, `git commit -m "my commit message"`, and `git push`
