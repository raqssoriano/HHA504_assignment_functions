# Serverless Computing and Cron Jobs

- **🎯** This task is part of my assignment focused on introducing _**serverless computing**_ and _**the use of cron jobs**_ in cloud environments. In this repository, I am working on deploying serverless functions on both *`Azure`* and *`Google Cloud Platform (GCP)`*, and attempting to create a **scheduled task** using **`GitHub Actions`**.

- **📝** Please refer to **[Functions.md](Functions.md)** for the _**steps**_, _**errors**_, and _**troubleshooting**_ I included in an attempt to complete this assignment.

- **🔗** Linked to this assignment is my **[504-Cron-Job](https://github.com/raqssoriano/504-cron-job.git)** repository, which was instrumental in successfully completing this task.

- **💡** Any feedback or suggestions are welcome to improve the content of this repository.
